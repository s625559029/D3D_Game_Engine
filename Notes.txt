-ISSUE: The Shader Resource View dimension declared in the shader code (TEXTURE2D) does not match the view type bound to slot 0 of the Pixel Shader unit (TEXTURECUBE).
REASON: Draw skybox function set shader resources to its own smrv but didn't set it back, need to set it back to out default.
SOLUTION: 1. Set shader resources to the default at the end of draw skybox function.
	  2. Move draw sky box to the end of draw scene function.
Currently don't know how to unbind shader resources, so set it to objects_pool->CubesTexture (created from ''grass.jpg'').

-ISSUE: How to print log?
SOLUTION: Use OutputDebugStringW(L"aaa") function.

-ISSUE: Height map is black if I don't draw ground first.
SOLUTION: Fill the constant buffer per object PSSetConstantBuffer when draw height map. 
Reason: Both VS stage and PS stage use the variables from constant buffer.
